Our topic is gonna be about using embryonic STEM cells to treat various conditions or illnesses


1. What is the technology or application itself?  How is it used?  What are the relevant facts about it? 


2. Based on research of specific examples, what are reasons for and against using this application of genetics?

The wide range of diseases it can treat	|The process of harvesting stem cells	


3. What regulations are currently in place? 

Canada does allow Stem Cell Research as long as they receive approval from the Stem Cell Oversight Committee (SCOC). For more information:

5. What is the ethical question surrounding it?   
This technology includes the process of destroying the human embryos. This is controversial because there are debates of when life begins. Some people believe that life begins in the embryos and thus the embryos should have the same moral rights as humans. Some other people believe that life doesn't start until after the embryo stage. Therefore, this technology has been largely controversial.

6. Who are the stakeholders in the ethical issue?  Who or what could be affected by how the question is resolved, whether that be for or against its continued use?  How will they be affected?  (hint: think about implications like moral, ethical, social, economic, environmental, political, etc) 
If this issue is resolved to be considered ethical, then the human embryos are going to be farmed as a place to retrieve ES cells. Thus we are potentially farming our own species and use those “potential humans” as a way to obtain their cells in order to treat diseases
Since this technology is used for curing diseases, if the issue is resolved to be considered unethical, then patients / people who have concerns about those diseases will not be pleased. This would probably continue to be a topic of controversy even it is considered unethical. Government researchers are also in the process of researching new ways to cure the same diseases to replace editing of embryo STEM cells, when or if the public decides that it is ethical, who would fund researches for further cures?
